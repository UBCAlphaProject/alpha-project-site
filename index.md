# What is Alpha Project?


Alpha Project is a club in which everyone collectively works on a single software project over the course of the whole year. Executives are assigned specific roles and titles on the team, and are responsible for collaborating with others to complete the project. The project Alpha Project creates must open source, and beneficial to the UBC community. As a result, there is no monetary motivation, and each member works in order to further their own CS skills.

In this club, you will be able to gain experience not only through coding, but through the various enrichment opportunities Alpha Project grants. For example, we will be hosting regular speaker nights, in which faculty members, alumni, students, and other honourable guests come and present about various paradigms of computer science. Due to the specificity of the club, guests will be able to cater the content to our members, and our project.

Additionally, Alpha Project is a fantastic opportunity to socialize with people who share your interests. With numerous socials throughout the year, you will create countless memories with the club. In the second semester, once the new SUB opens, Alpha Project will have a new home, with an office where members can spend their time in between classes to relax, do homework, socialize, eat, and work on the project. It acts as a central hub for all members to connect.

We are currently hiring, and have four positions available:

2 x Front End Software Engineer
2 x Back End Software Engineer

We are looking for students with experience in coding, and who are willing to work together on a team. Since teamwork is so vital to the project, the exec team is composed of only 7 people. As a result, membership fees are higher than typical clubs. The membership fee for Alpha Project is $100, which covers the whole school year. 

As an executive, you will be able to gain experience in a position relevant to your field of study. If you are interested in joining Alpha Project, please feel free to contact us at president@alphaproject.me

# Events

Alpha Project is designed to enrich the lives of all it's members. It begins with The Hub. Once the new SUB is constructed (Jan 2015), Alpha Project members will have access to an exclusive office space, where all members come to relax between class, socialize, work on homework, and collaborate on the project. The Hub is where Alpha Project lives.

Alpha Project offers continuous learning opportunities with renown faculty members, students, and alumni coming to speak about various aspects of Computer Science. Due to the size of the club, these guest speakers can focus on issues and topics which are relevant to the project and members of Alpha Project.

Play Hard. Work Hard. Alpha Project hosts regular social events, providing members with time to create real friendships. Between classes, at club events, while working, or at a night out, you will always find a time to hang out with people who share your interests and passions.
